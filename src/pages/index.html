        <li>59.5 million displaced people worldwide</li>
        <li>19.5 million refugees</li>
        <li>$27 million spent per day on relief and aid for displaced people</li>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Organizations working on the crisis don't have the luxury to step back and create proactive solutions, they only have time to react. </p>
      <p>This is where we as digital workers (who are not on the front-line) have an opportunity to help create positive change in a broken world...</p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <h3>build local and global communities<i class="i-checkbox-checked"> </i></h3>
      <p>We have a team of passionate and skilled professionals collaborating to solve the problems of the refugee crisis from across the globe. We're using <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> to communicate in real-time and we are growing fast.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in starting an Prosper meetup in your city, <a href="mailto:john@solvetherefugeecrisis.com?subject=Prosper%20Meetup">send us a message.</a></p>
      <h3>discover problems<i class="i-checkbox-checked"></i></h3>
      <p>We are currently researching the problems that refugees, refugee representatives and organizations like  <a href="http://refugees-welcome.net">Refugees Welcome</a> are facing amidst the crisis. We are interviewing founders and workers in organizations all over the world and discussing the problems we discover with our team on the Slack channel.</p>
      <h3>pick a first problem<i class="i-checkbox-checked"></i></h3>
      <p>We have chosen our first problem to solve:</p>
      <p>Projects doing meaningful work within the refugee crisis are scattered all across the web. This causes a major issue:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This makes it difficult for refugees, volunteers, and funders to find exactly what they are looking for.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>solve the problem<i class="i-checkbox-unchecked"></i></h3>
      <p>We are currently working on a solution to this problem. We have a prototype up and running: <a href="http://refugeeprojects.com/">RefugeeProjects.com</a> to seed an initial database of meaningful projects across the refugee crisis.</p>
      <p>If you're interested to see how the project is progressing, you can take a look at our Trello board: <a href="https://trello.com/b/CfwoEGLi/prosper-refugeeprojects">Prosper RefugeeProjects</a></p>
      <h3>document process<i class="i-checkbox-unchecked"></i></h3>
      <p>As we solve the problem, we are documenting our process so that we can empower other teams who want to solve a specific problem of the refugee crisis.</p>
      <h3>launch apprenticeship<i class="i-checkbox-unchecked"></i></h3>
      <p>In February we plan to launch the first digital apprenticeship for refugees. We're teaming up with <a href="http://refugeesonrails.org/">Refugees On Rails</a> to help graduates from their first cohort get real-world collaborative coding experience working on Prosper projects. We're currently raising funds to build a scholarship bursary for the apprenticeship and would love to speak with anyone interested in this program.</p>
      <p>Potential apprentices must have the ability to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read and write HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby</li>
        <li>Build CRUD applications in Rails provided project specifications</li>
        <li>Collaborate using Git and Github</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We're going to pair our apprentices with senior Ruby developers who will mentor apprentices through working on project tasks and collaborating with an interdisciplinary team.</p>
