          If three Dutch entrepreneurs could create an <a href="http://www.refugeehero.com/">Airbnb for refugees</a> in three days, what would happen if the brightest minds from around the world joined together in one place to talk about the problems at hand? What kind of solutions would we see?

        <p>
          What better opportunity for innovation than a complex problem that is facing millions of people from all over the world?
        </p>
        <p>
          How could we break this problem into smaller parts? How can we apply the best of technology and design to solving the problems of the refugee crisis?

          Whether you're an entrepreneur, a writer, designer, developer, government official, student, or just someone who wants to help&mdash;join our community and offer your help to those in need.

        <h2>What's The Story?</h2>
        <p>
          The idea for this community began when a young couple heard about <a href="http://www.refugees-welcome.net/">Refugees Welcome</a>, a project in Austria and Germany that pairs refugees with accommodation in shared flats. <a href="http://john-ellison.com">John</a> and <a href="https://sophieellison.design">Sophie Ellison</a> had just moved to the UK and wanted to have a refugee live with them in their home.
        </p>
        <h3>Contacting Refugees Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          When the Ellisons contacted Refugees Welcome, it took weeks to get a response. The organization was overloaded with requests from hundreds of people asking if they could help set up Refugees Welcome in their country.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Refugees Welcome representative finally got back in touch with The Ellisons and introduced them to a group of individuals in the UK who also wanted to help refugees.
        </p>
        <h3>A Scattered Conversation</h3>
        <p>
          In the weeks that ensued, thousands of emails were exchanged between caring people from across the UK who wanted to help setup a Refugees Welcome branch in England. As Refugees Welcome gained publicity, the list of participants grew and the conversation scattered across several different platforms: Facebook, Google, and Skype&mdash;just to name a few. It was difficult for John and Sophie to keep up with the conversation because they had full-time jobs and there was no structure or order to the conversation.
        </p>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/willsh">John Willshire</a>'s <em>Popular Thing for Broken Thing</em> workshop, John Ellison had an idea to take a popular thing (<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>&mdash;a successful team communication app) to help fix a broken thing (the refugee crisis). In pairing two sticky notes together, the concept for Refugee Community was born. You can read more about the workshop on <a href="https://90days.john-ellison.com/2015/day-43-popular-thing-for-broken-thing-workshop">John's 90 Day blog.</a>

        <h2>The Time is Now</h2>
        <p>
          This is a unique moment in history, but the problems we are facing are not necessarily new. We have seen wars, genocide, disease and famine before. We have seen natural disasters, discrimination and murder. We have seen it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now&mdash;more than ever before&mdash;we have the power to solve problems. The power is at our fingertips. We have access to world's information at the palm of our hands. We can learn how to do anything. We can speak with anyone. We can share what we have learned and people will listen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital era is changing our world. Technology and design together have transformed life as we know it. While many of these innovations have made our lives better and some have made them worse, we are just beginning to see the potential of technology and design to make an impact and help real people with real problems. The question then becomes <em>how</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer lies in working together. Together, we are better. We can help the Syrian refugee crisis. Together we can understand the diverse needs of people from all over the world who are suffering and fleeing from persecution. If we work together we can help make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot back and watch while the rest of the world takes action. We cannot sit back and watch while the trains full of men, women and children roll by the countryside. We cannot sit back and watch the gray clouds of black smoke fill up the silent blue sky.
