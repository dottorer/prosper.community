        <h2>Prosper Academy</h2>
        <h4 class="subheader">An online apprenticeship for designers and developers to grow their skills through contributing to meaningful projects</h4>
      </hgroup>
      <h3>listening to our community</h3>
      <p>
         After launching Prosper, we learned that there's a large community of designers and developers that have enough skills to contribute to a project but lack the experience to launch a meaningful career.
      </p>

      <p>
        In talking to dozens of people, we learned that every person has a unique set of skills, experience and needs. Rather than prescribe a set curriculum to help people grow, we've chosen to work with each apprentice to define a <strong>custom skill plan</strong> that reflects their needs and experience. This allows each apprentice to grow in the directtion and manner that suits them best.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a skill plan in place, we match apprentices to real tasks on <a href="#projects">Prosper projects</a>. This allows apprentices to <strong>learn by doing</strong> while also having the <strong>freedom to fail</strong> and support of an expert mentor.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structure reflects our belief that people learn best when they:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>are <strong>driven by passion</strong> and</li>
        <li>can collaborate with other professionals on <strong>meaningful projects</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>our solution</h3>
      <p>
        We've designed a custom platform where apprentices (citizens and refugees alike):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Work with a career coach to define a <strong>custom skill plan</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborate with an interdisciplinary team on <strong>real projects</strong> within the refugee crisis
        </li>
        <li>
          Meet weekly with an <strong>expert mentor</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Use design and technology to <strong>solve real problems</strong> for real people </li>
        <li>
          Learn to <strong>articulate decisions</strong> to the project team
        </li>
        <li>Gain relevant experience and contacts to <strong>land a dream job</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Two Tracks</h4>
      <p>
         Because most of our apprentices already have experience in the industry and are looking to gain specialized skills, we've structured our course as two parallel tracks that collaborate with one another on <a href="#projects">Prosper projects</a>:

      <h3>open enrollment</h3>
      <p>
        If you're interested in growing your skills through contributing to meaningful projects, please submit your details below. We will follow-up with an interview request so that we can begin to craft your <strong>custom skill plan</strong> based upon your experience, goals, and lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that the needs of each apprentice is different, and that's why we take the time to develop a custom plan to meet your needs.
      </p>


      <h3>bursary for refugees</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a refugee and are interested in joining Prosper Academy but don't have the funds, you can inquire about our bursary by submitting your details below. We've also designed a structured framework to support people from challenging circumstances. We are sensitive to the fact that our bursary applicants may have unique lifestyle obstacles and are prepared to work with you to create the right environment for you to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide specialized training for our mentors who work with refugees so that we can <strong>nuture well-being</strong> and <strong>self-confidence</strong> as well as <strong>employability</strong>. Being proficient in English is currently a pre-requisite, but we are constantly working to broaden the languages of our mentor group in order to support a more diverse community of apprentices.
