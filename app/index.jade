        h3 Step 1: launch a real-time forum
        p We have a team of digital workers collaborating to solve the problems of the refugee crisis in real-time from across the globe. We've setup a team on 
          a(href="https://slack.com") Slack
          |  and have started inviting talented and passionate digital workers to join.
        h3 Step 2: discover &amp; expose problems

          strong  real problems
          |  that people in organizations like  
          a(href="http://refugees-welcome.net") Refugees Welcome
          |  are face in trying to help refugees on the ground.
        p We are publishing our research as a platform for  teams of digital workers to gain insights on the problems of the refugee crisis and learn where help is needed most.
        
        h3 Step 3: empower teams
        p With a range of explicit problems that need to be urgently solved, we are empowering self-leading teams to apply human-centered design thinking to  
          strong effectively
          |  concept and prototype 
          strong immediate 
          |  solutions.
        p We are currently working on an open-source field guide called "Human-Centered Design Thinking: Solving The Problems of The Refuge Crisis&mdash;NOW."
        p Our global community acts as a support network for our teams to consult expert advice from around the world.
        
        h3 Step 4: iterate, iterate, iterate
        p With working prototypes out the field we are encouraging our teams to implement the lean 'Build, Measure, Learn' cycle to iterate from protototype to effective solutions.
