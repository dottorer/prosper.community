        p As a first step, we created a team on 
          a(href="https://slack.com") Slack
          | , a team communication app with a world-class user experience, so that people solving the crisis can collaborate.
        p The problem of the refugee crisis is complex and cannot be solved by a single government or organization. We need radical collaboration between parties, and this requires seamless communication.
        p Slack is the best tool for the job, and its free.
