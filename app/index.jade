        h2 The Solution
        h3 Step 1: launch a real-time forum
        p Our goal is to enable leaders working on the refugee crisis to collaborate and communicate with one another in real-time from across the globe. 
          a(href="https://slack.com") Slack
          |  was the best tool for the job, so we setup a team on Slack and have started inviting leaders to join.
        h3 Step 2: find problem-solution fit
        p Our goal is to work as a team to explicitly define the problem of the refugee crisis. With a clear problem definition, we want to apply 
          a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking") design thinking
          |  to generate a diverse spectrum of possible solutions ranging from the immediate to the long-term.
        h3 Step 3: implement solutions
        p Our goal is to centralize the efforts of governments, NGO's and RCO's toward the implementation of immediate and long-term solutions. With a real-time forum supporting our efforts, the aim is to provide radical collaboration through seamless communication and transparency.
