    <h3>the situation</h3>
    <p>
      Coding bootcamps like <a href="http://thefirehoseproject.com">The Firehose Project</a> and <a href="http://refugeesonrails.org">Refugees on Rails</a> are great at teaching people how to code, but that often isn't enough to land a dream job in the industry. A portion of bootcamp graduates have the skills to contribute to a project but lack the experience to launch a meaningful career.
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <h3>our solution</h3>
    <p>
      We've designed a pay-as-you-go apprenticeship where bootcamp graduates (citizens and asylum seekers alike):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Collaborate with an interdisciplinary team on <strong>real projects</strong> within the refugee crisis
      </li>
      <li>
        Meet weekly with an <strong>expert mentor</strong> and monthly with a <strong>career coach</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Use design and technology to <strong>solve real problems</strong> for real people </li>
      <li>
        Learn to <strong>articulate decisions</strong> to the project team
      </li>
      <li>Gain relevant experience and contacts to <strong>land a dream job</strong> within their discipline.</li>
    </ul>
