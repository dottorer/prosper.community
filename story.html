  <h2>What's The Story?</h2>
  <p>
    The idea for this community began when a young couple heard about <a href="http://www.refugees-welcome.net/">Refugees Welcome</a>, a project in Austria and Germany that pairs refugees with accommodation in shared flats. <a href="http://john-ellison.com">John</a> and <a href="https://sophieellison.design">Sophie Ellison</a> had just moved to the UK and wanted to have a refugee live with them in their home.

  <h3>Contacting Refugees Welcome</h3>
  <p>
    When the Ellisons contacted Refugees Welcome, it took weeks to get a response. The organization was overloaded with requests from hundreds of people asking if they could help set up Refugees Welcome in their country.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Refugees Welcome representative finally got back in touch with The Ellisons and introduced them to a group of individuals in the UK who also wanted to help refugees.

  <h3>A Scattered Conversation</h3>
  <p>
    In the weeks that ensued, thousands of emails were exchanged between caring people from across the UK who wanted to help setup a Refugees Welcome branch in England. As Refugees Welcome gained publicity, the list of participants grew and the conversation scattered across several different platforms: Facebook, Google, and Skype&mdash;just to name a few. It was difficult for John and Sophie to keep up with the conversation because they had full-time jobs and there was no structure or order to the conversation.

  <h3>Inspiration</h3>
  <p>
    Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/willsh">John Willshire</a>'s <em>Popular Thing for Broken Thing</em> workshop, John Ellison had an idea to take a popular thing (<a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>&mdash;a successful team communication app) to help fix a broken thing (the refugee crisis). In pairing two sticky notes together, the concept for Refugee Community was born.
