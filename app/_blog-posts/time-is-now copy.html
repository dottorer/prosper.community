  <h2>The Time is Now</h2>
  <p>
    This is a unique moment in history, but the problems we are facing are not necessarily new. We have seen wars, genocide, disease and famine before. We have seen natural disasters, discrimination and murder. We have seen it all.
  </p>
  <p>
    But now&mdash;more than ever before&mdash;we have the power to solve problems. The power is at our fingertips. We have access to world's information at the palm of our hands. We can learn how to do anything. We can speak with anyone. We can share what we have learned and people will listen.
  </p>
  <p>
    The digital era is changing our world. Technology and design together have transformed life as we know it. While many of these innovations have made our lives better and some have made them worse, we are just beginning to see the potential of technology and design to make an impact and help real people with real problems. The question then becomes <em>how</em>?
  </p>
  <p>
    The answer lies in working together. Together, we are better. We can help the Syrian refugee crisis. Together we can understand the diverse needs of people from all over the world who are suffering and fleeing from persecution. If we work together we can help make a difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    We cannot back and watch while the rest of the world takes action. We cannot sit back and watch while the trains full of men, women and children roll by the countryside. We cannot sit back and watch the gray clouds of black smoke fill up the silent blue sky.
