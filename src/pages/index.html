        <h4 class="subheader">An online apprenticeship with a bursary for refugees</h4>

      <!-- <h3>the situation</h3> -->
      <p>
        Coding bootcamps like <a href="http://thefirehoseproject.com">The Firehose Project</a> and <a href="http://refugeesonrails.org">Refugees on Rails</a> are great at teaching people how to code, but that often isn't enough to land a dream job in the industry. A portion of bootcamp graduates have the skills to contribute to a project but lack the experience to launch a meaningful career.
      </p>

      <p>
        Design bootcamps like <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-bootcamp">General Assembly</a> and <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/">DesignLab</a> are great at teaching fundamentals, but lack the meaningful projects that reveal the true power of human-centered design. Most designers end up working on  initiatives with no real purpose or passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Prosper, we believe that people learn best by doing <strong>meaningful work</strong> with a <strong>passion</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>our solution</h3>
      <p>
        We've designed a pay-as-you-go program where apprentices (citizens and refugees):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Collaborate with an interdisciplinary team on <strong>real projects</strong> within the refugee crisis
        </li>
        <li>
          Meet weekly with an <strong>expert mentor</strong> and monthly with a <strong>career coach</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Use design and technology to <strong>solve real problems</strong> for real people </li>
        <li>
          Learn to <strong>articulate decisions</strong> to the project team
        </li>
        <li>Gain relevant experience and contacts to <strong>land a dream job</strong> within their discipline.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Two Tracks</h4>
      <p>
        Because the strength of a digital worker is becoming increasingly dependant on collaboration, we've decided to run two simultaneous tracks that work together within our apprenticeship:

      <h3>now accepting applications</h3>
      <p>
        We are currently accepting applications for the Prosper Academy. If you're interested, please submit your details below. We will follow-up with an interview request so that we can begin to understand you and your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that the needs of each apprentice is different, and that's why we don't prescribe a single curriculum but rather allow real projects to form the basis of experiential learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also provide specialized training for our mentors who work with apprentices that come from challenging circumstances so that we can focus on building holistic well-being, self-confidence and employability.
      </p>

      <h3>pricing</h3>
      <p>
        After talking to prospective apprentices within the Prosper Community,  we've developed a flexible pricing and service structure to accommodate for a wide range of needs and life circumstances.
      </p>
      <table class="pricing-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Monthly</th>
            <th>Three Months</th>
            <th>Six Months</th>
            <th>Refugee</th>
          </tr>
